Learn C programming from scratch! Complete beginner's guide with examples, exercises, and step-by-step instructions to master C basics.

---

## **Introduction**

Welcome to the fascinating world of C programming! If you've ever wondered how computers really work under the hood, or if you're looking to build a solid foundation for your programming journey, you've come to the right place. C is often called the "mother of all programming languages," and for good reason – it's the foundation upon which many modern languages are built.

Don't worry if you've never written a single line of code before. This guide is designed specifically for absolute beginners, and I'll walk you through everything step by step. By the end of this post, you'll have written your first C program and understood the fundamental concepts that will serve you throughout your programming career.

Let's dive in and discover why C is still one of the most important programming languages to learn in 2025!

---

## **What is C Programming?**

C is a general-purpose programming language that was developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. Think of C as the grandfather of modern programming languages – it's been around for over **50 years** and is still widely used today.

### **Why Learn C?**

Learning C offers several compelling advantages:

**Foundation for Understanding**: C teaches you how computers actually work at a **low level**. When you understand C, you understand memory management, pointers, and how programs interact with hardware.

**Performance**: C programs are incredibly fast because they compile directly to machine code. This makes C perfect for system programming, embedded systems, and performance-critical applications.

**Portability**: C code can run on virtually any platform with minimal modifications. Write once, compile anywhere!

**Career Opportunities**: C is used in operating systems (Linux, Windows), embedded systems, game engines, databases, and countless other applications. Major companies like Google, Microsoft, and Apple use C extensively.

**Gateway to Other Languages**: Once you master C, learning languages like C++, Java, or Python becomes much easier because they share similar syntax and concepts.

## **Setting Up Your Development Environment**

Before we start coding, we need to set up our development environment. Don't worry – this is easier than it sounds!

### **Step 1: Choose a Compiler**

A compiler translates your C code into machine language that your computer can understand. Here are the most popular options:

**For Windows:**

* **MinGW-w64**: Free and easy to install
    
* **Microsoft Visual Studio**: Professional-grade IDE with excellent debugging tools
    
* **Code::Blocks**: Beginner-friendly IDE with built-in compiler
    

**For macOS:**

* **Xcode Command Line Tools**: Built into macOS
    
* **Homebrew with GCC**: More flexibility for advanced users
    

**For Linux:**

* **GCC**: Usually pre-installed on most distributions
    
* **Clang**: Alternative compiler with excellent error messages
    

### **Step 2: Install Your Compiler**

Let's walk through installing GCC (GNU Compiler Collection), which is available on all platforms:

**Windows (using MinGW):**

1. Download MinGW-w64 from the official website [mingw-w64.org](https://www.mingw-w64.org/)
    
2. Run the installer and follow the setup wizard
    
3. Add MinGW to your system PATH
    
4. Open Command Prompt and type `gcc --version` to verify installation
    

**macOS:**

1. Open Terminal
    
2. Run `xcode-select --install`
    
3. Follow the installation prompts
    
4. Verify with `gcc --version`
    

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gcc
gcc --version
```

### **Step 3: Choose a Text Editor**

While you can write C code in any text editor, using one with syntax highlighting makes life much easier:

* **VS Code**: Free, powerful, with excellent C/C++ extensions
    
* **Sublime Text**: Fast and lightweight
    
* **Vim/Emacs**: For those who prefer terminal-based editors
    
* **Code::Blocks**: Complete IDE solution

## **Your First C Program**

Now for the exciting part – writing your first C program! Let's start with the traditional "Hello, World!" program.

### **The Classic Hello World**

Create a new file called `hello.c` and type the following code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

Let's break down what each part does:

`#include <stdio.h>`: This is a **preprocessor directive** that tells the compiler to include the standard input/output library. Think of it as importing a toolbox that contains functions like `printf()`.

`int main()`: This is the main function where your program execution begins. Every C program must have exactly one `main()` function. The `int` means this function returns an integer value.

`printf("Hello, World!\n");`: This function prints text to the screen. The `\n` is an escape sequence that creates a new line.

`return 0;`: This tells the operating system that your program finished successfully. A return value of 0 typically means "no errors occurred."

### **Compiling and Running Your Program**

To turn your C code into an executable program:

1. Open your terminal/command prompt
    
2. Navigate to the directory containing your `hello.c` file
    
3. Compile the program:
    

```bash
   gcc hello.c -o hello
```

1. Run the program:
    

```bash
   ./hello        # On macOS/Linux
   hello.exe      # On Windows
```

You should see "Hello, World!" printed to your screen. Congratulations – you've just written and executed your first C program!

## **Understanding C Syntax and Structure**

Now that you've written your first program, let's dive deeper into C's syntax and structure.

### **Comments**

Comments are notes you leave in your code for yourself and other programmers. They're ignored by the compiler:

```c
// This is a single-line comment

/* This is a
   multi-line comment */

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Print greeting to user
    printf("Welcome to C programming!\n");

    /* 
     * This section could be expanded
     * to include more functionality
     */

    return 0;
}
```

### **Case Sensitivity**

C is case-sensitive, which means `Variable`, `variable`, and `VARIABLE` are three different identifiers:

```c
int age = 25;      // This is different from
int Age = 30;      // this variable
int AGE = 35;      // and this one too
```

### **Semicolons**

Every statement in C must end with a semicolon (`;`). Think of it as the period at the end of a sentence:

```c
printf("First statement\n");    // Semicolon required
int number = 42;                // Semicolon required
return 0;                       // Semicolon required
```

### **Whitespace**

C ignores extra spaces, tabs, and newlines, so you can format your code for readability:

```c
// These are equivalent:
int x=5;int y=10;printf("Sum: %d\n",x+y);

// Better formatting:
int x = 5;
int y = 10;
printf("Sum: %d\n", x + y);
```

---

## **Variables and Data Types**

Variables are containers that store data values. In C, you must declare a variable's type before using it.

### **Basic Data Types**

C provides several fundamental data types:

**Integer Types:**

```c
int age = 25;           // Whole numbers (-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647)
short small_num = 100;  // Smaller integers (-32,768 to 32,767)
long big_num = 1000000; // Larger integers
```

**Floating-Point Types:**

```c
float price = 19.99;         // Single precision decimal
double precise_pi = 3.14159; // Double precision decimal
```

**Character Type:**

```c
char grade = 'A';           // Single character
char letter = 65;           // ASCII value (also represents 'A')
```

### **Variable Declaration and Initialization**

You can declare variables in two ways:

```c
// Declaration (creating the variable)
int number;

// Initialization (giving it a value)
number = 42;

// Declaration and initialization in one line
int another_number = 100;

// Multiple variables of the same type
int x, y, z;
x = 10;
y = 20;
z = 30;

// Or initialize multiple variables
int a = 1, b = 2, c = 3;
```

### **Variable Naming Rules**

Follow these rules when naming variables:

1. Must start with a letter or underscore
    
2. Can contain letters, digits, and underscores
    
3. Cannot be a reserved keyword
    
4. Case-sensitive
    

```c
// Valid variable names
int age;
int student_count;
int _private_var;
int userAge2;

// Invalid variable names
int 2age;        // Cannot start with digit
int user-name;   // Cannot contain hyphen
int int;         // Cannot use reserved keyword
```

### **Practical Example: Personal Information Program**

Let's create a program that demonstrates different data types:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Personal information variables
    char first_initial = 'J';
    char last_initial = 'D';
    int age = 28;
    float height = 5.9;
    double salary = 45000.50;

    // Display the information
    printf("Personal Information:\n");
    printf("Initials: %c.%c.\n", first_initial, last_initial);
    printf("Age: %d years old\n", age);
    printf("Height: %.1f feet\n", height);
    printf("Salary: $%.2f\n", salary);

    return 0;
}
```

Notice the format specifiers:

* `%c` for characters
    
* `%d` for integers
    
* `%f` for floats
    
* `%.1f` for floats with 1 decimal place
    
* `%.2f` for floats with 2 decimal places

## **Basic Input and Output**

Interaction with users is crucial in programming. Let's learn how to get input from users and display output.

### **Output with printf()**

The `printf()` function is your primary tool for displaying information:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int apples = 10;
    float price = 2.50;
    char grade = 'A';

    // Basic output
    printf("I have %d apples.\n", apples);
    printf("Each apple costs $%.2f\n", price);
    printf("My grade is %c.\n", grade);

    // Multiple values in one printf
    printf("Total cost: $%.2f for %d apples\n", price * apples, apples);

    return 0;
}
```

### **Input with scanf()**

The `scanf()` function reads input from the user:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int age;
    float height;
    char initial;

    // Getting input from user
    printf("Enter your age: ");
    scanf("%d", &age);

    printf("Enter your height (in feet): ");
    scanf("%f", &height);

    printf("Enter your first initial: ");
    scanf(" %c", &initial);  // Note the space before %c

    // Display the information
    printf("\nYour Information:\n");
    printf("Age: %d years\n", age);
    printf("Height: %.1f feet\n", height);
    printf("Initial: %c\n", initial);

    return 0;
}
```

**Important Notes about scanf():**

* Use `&` before variable names (we'll learn why later)
    
* Add a space before `%c` to consume any whitespace
    
* `scanf()` stops reading at the first whitespace for strings
    

### **Interactive Example: Simple Calculator**

Let's create a program that takes two numbers and performs basic arithmetic:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    float num1, num2;

    printf("=== Simple Calculator ===\n");
    printf("Enter first number: ");
    scanf("%f", &num1);

    printf("Enter second number: ");
    scanf("%f", &num2);

    printf("\nResults:\n");
    printf("%.2f + %.2f = %.2f\n", num1, num2, num1 + num2);
    printf("%.2f - %.2f = %.2f\n", num1, num2, num1 - num2);
    printf("%.2f * %.2f = %.2f\n", num1, num2, num1 * num2);

    if (num2 != 0) {
        printf("%.2f / %.2f = %.2f\n", num1, num2, num1 / num2);
    } else {
        printf("Cannot divide by zero!\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

---

## **Operators in C**

Operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values. C provides several types of operators.

### **Arithmetic Operators**

These operators perform mathematical calculations:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a = 10, b = 3;

    printf("a = %d, b = %d\n", a, b);
    printf("Addition: %d + %d = %d\n", a, b, a + b);
    printf("Subtraction: %d - %d = %d\n", a, b, a - b);
    printf("Multiplication: %d * %d = %d\n", a, b, a * b);
    printf("Division: %d / %d = %d\n", a, b, a / b);
    printf("Modulus: %d %% %d = %d\n", a, b, a % b);

    return 0;
}
```

**Key Points:**

* `/` performs integer division when both operands are integers
    
* `%` (modulus) gives the remainder of division
    
* Use `%%` in printf to display a literal `%` character
    

### **Assignment Operators**

These operators assign values to variables:

```c
int x = 10;        // Basic assignment
x += 5;            // x = x + 5 (now x is 15)
x -= 3;            // x = x - 3 (now x is 12)
x *= 2;            // x = x * 2 (now x is 24)
x /= 4;            // x = x / 4 (now x is 6)
x %= 4;            // x = x % 4 (now x is 2)
```

### **Comparison Operators**

These operators compare values and return true (1) or false (0):

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a = 5, b = 10;

    printf("a = %d, b = %d\n", a, b);
    printf("a == b: %d\n", a == b);  // Equal to
    printf("a != b: %d\n", a != b);  // Not equal to
    printf("a < b: %d\n", a < b);    // Less than
    printf("a > b: %d\n", a > b);    // Greater than
    printf("a <= b: %d\n", a <= b);  // Less than or equal
    printf("a >= b: %d\n", a >= b);  // Greater than or equal

    return 0;
}
```

### **Logical Operators**

These operators combine boolean expressions:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int age = 25;
    int has_license = 1;  // 1 for true, 0 for false

    // AND operator (&&)
    if (age >= 18 && has_license) {
        printf("You can drive!\n");
    }

    // OR operator (||)
    if (age < 16 || age > 65) {
        printf("Special driving rules may apply.\n");
    }

    // NOT operator (!)
    if (!has_license) {
        printf("You need to get a license first.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### **Increment and Decrement Operators**

These operators increase or decrease a variable's value by 1:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int counter = 5;

    printf("Initial counter: %d\n", counter);

    // Post-increment (use current value, then increment)
    printf("Post-increment: %d\n", counter++);
    printf("After post-increment: %d\n", counter);

    // Pre-increment (increment first, then use value)
    printf("Pre-increment: %d\n", ++counter);

    // Post-decrement
    printf("Post-decrement: %d\n", counter--);
    printf("After post-decrement: %d\n", counter);

    // Pre-decrement
    printf("Pre-decrement: %d\n", --counter);

    return 0;
}
```

---

## **Control Structures**

Control structures allow you to control the flow of your program's execution.

### **Conditional Statements (if, else if, else)**

Use conditional statements to make decisions in your program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int score;

    printf("Enter your test score (0-100): ");
    scanf("%d", &score);

    if (score >= 90) {
        printf("Grade: A - Excellent work!\n");
    } else if (score >= 80) {
        printf("Grade: B - Good job!\n");
    } else if (score >= 70) {
        printf("Grade: C - Satisfactory.\n");
    } else if (score >= 60) {
        printf("Grade: D - Needs improvement.\n");
    } else {
        printf("Grade: F - Please study more.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### **Switch Statement**

Use switch statements when you have multiple specific values to check:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int day;

    printf("Enter a day number (1-7): ");
    scanf("%d", &day);

    switch (day) {
        case 1:
            printf("Monday - Start of the work week!\n");
            break;
        case 2:
            printf("Tuesday - Keep going!\n");
            break;
        case 3:
            printf("Wednesday - Hump day!\n");
            break;
        case 4:
            printf("Thursday - Almost there!\n");
            break;
        case 5:
            printf("Friday - TGIF!\n");
            break;
        case 6:
            printf("Saturday - Weekend!\n");
            break;
        case 7:
            printf("Sunday - Rest day!\n");
            break;
        default:
            printf("Invalid day number! Please enter 1-7.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**Important:** Always include `break` statements to prevent fall-through behavior.

### **Loops**

Loops allow you to repeat code multiple times.

#### **For Loop**

Use for loops when you know exactly how many times you want to repeat:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Print numbers 1 to 10
    printf("Counting from 1 to 10:\n");
    for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
        printf("%d ", i);
    }
    printf("\n");

    // Calculate factorial
    int n = 5;
    int factorial = 1;

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        factorial *= i;
    }

    printf("Factorial of %d is %d\n", n, factorial);

    return 0;
}
```

#### **While Loop**

Use while loops when you want to repeat based on a condition:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int number, guess;
    int attempts = 0;

    printf("I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 10...\n");
    number = 7;  // Secret number

    while (guess != number) {
        printf("Enter your guess: ");
        scanf("%d", &guess);
        attempts++;

        if (guess < number) {
            printf("Too low! Try again.\n");
        } else if (guess > number) {
            printf("Too high! Try again.\n");
        } else {
            printf("Congratulations! You guessed it in %d attempts!\n", attempts);
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```

#### **Do-While Loop**

Use do-while loops when you want to execute the loop at least once:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int choice;

    do {
        printf("\n=== Menu ===\n");
        printf("1. Say Hello\n");
        printf("2. Current Time\n");
        printf("3. Exit\n");
        printf("Enter your choice: ");
        scanf("%d", &choice);

        switch (choice) {
            case 1:
                printf("Hello, World!\n");
                break;
            case 2:
                printf("Feature not implemented yet.\n");
                break;
            case 3:
                printf("Goodbye!\n");
                break;
            default:
                printf("Invalid choice. Please try again.\n");
        }
    } while (choice != 3);

    return 0;
}
```

---

## **Functions**

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They help organize your code and avoid repetition.

### **Function Basics**

Here's the basic structure of a function:

```c
return_type function_name(parameters) {
    // Function body
    return value;  // if return_type is not void
}
```

### **Creating Your First Function**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Function declaration (prototype)
int add(int a, int b);
void greet(char name[]);
float calculate_area(float radius);

int main() {
    // Using functions
    int result = add(5, 3);
    printf("5 + 3 = %d\n", result);

    greet("Alice");

    float area = calculate_area(3.0);
    printf("Area of circle with radius 3.0: %.2f\n", area);

    return 0;
}

// Function definitions
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

void greet(char name[]) {
    printf("Hello, %s!\n", name);
}

float calculate_area(float radius) {
    return 3.14159 * radius * radius;
}
```

### **Function Parameters and Return Values**

Functions can accept parameters (inputs) and return values (outputs):

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Function with no parameters, returns int
int get_random_number() {
    return 42;  // Not really random, but you get the idea
}

// Function with parameters, returns float
float calculate_bmi(float weight, float height) {
    return weight / (height * height);
}

// Function with parameters, no return value
void print_rectangle(int width, int height) {
    for (int i = 0; i < height; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < width; j++) {
            printf("* ");
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
}

int main() {
    int num = get_random_number();
    printf("Random number: %d\n", num);

    float bmi = calculate_bmi(70.0, 1.75);
    printf("BMI: %.2f\n", bmi);

    printf("Rectangle:\n");
    print_rectangle(5, 3);

    return 0;
}
```

### **Practical Example: Temperature Converter**

Let's create a program with functions that converts temperatures:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Function prototypes
float celsius_to_fahrenheit(float celsius);
float fahrenheit_to_celsius(float fahrenheit);

## **Arrays**

Arrays are collections of elements of the same type, stored in contiguous memory locations.

### **Array Basics**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Declaring and initializing arrays
    int numbers[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    char grades[4] = {'A', 'B', 'C', 'D'};

    // Accessing array elements (0-indexed)
    printf("First number: %d\n", numbers[0]);
    printf("Last number: %d\n", numbers[4]);

    // Modifying array elements
    numbers[2] = 35;
    printf("Modified third number: %d\n", numbers[2]);

    // Printing all elements
    printf("All numbers: ");
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        printf("%d ", numbers[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");

    return 0;
}
```

### **Working with Arrays**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int scores[10];
    int count = 0;
    int sum = 0;
    int highest = 0;
    int lowest = 100;

    // Get scores from user
    printf("Enter up to 10 test scores (enter -1 to finish):\n");

    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        printf("Score %d: ", i + 1);
        scanf("%d", &scores[i]);

        if (scores[i] == -1) {
            break;  // Stop if user enters -1
        }

        count++;
        sum += scores[i];

        if (scores[i] > highest) {
            highest = scores[i];
        }

        if (scores[i] < lowest) {
            lowest = scores[i];
        }
    }

    // Calculate and display results
    if (count > 0) {
        float average = (float)sum / count;

        printf("\n=== Results ===\n");
        printf("Number of scores: %d\n", count);
        printf("Total: %d\n", sum);
        printf("Average: %.2f\n", average);
        printf("Highest: %d\n", highest);
        printf("Lowest: %d\n", lowest);

        printf("\nAll scores: ");
        for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
            printf("%d ", scores[i]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    } else {
        printf("No scores entered.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### **String Arrays**

In C, strings are arrays of characters:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char name[50];
    char greeting[100];

    // Getting string input
    printf("Enter your name: ");
    fgets(name, sizeof(name), stdin);

    // Remove newline character if present
    name[strcspn(name, "\n")] = '\0';

    // Creating formatted strings
    sprintf(greeting, "Hello, %s! Welcome to C programming.", name);

    printf("%s\n", greeting);

    // String length
    printf("Your name has %lu characters.\n", strlen(name));

    return 0;
}
```

---

## **Best Practices and Common Mistakes**

### **Best Practices**

**1\. Use Meaningful Variable Names**

```c
// Bad
int x = 25;
float y = 5.9;

// Good
int student_age = 25;
float student_height = 5.9;
```

**2\. Initialize Variables**

```c
// Bad - uninitialized variables can contain garbage values
int count;
printf("%d\n", count);  // Unpredictable output

// Good
int count = 0;
printf("%d\n", count);  // Predictable output
```

**3\. Use Constants for Fixed Values**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define PI 3.14159
#define MAX_STUDENTS 50

int main() {
    float radius = 5.0;
    float area = PI * radius * radius;

    printf("Area: %.2f\n", area);
    return 0;
}
```

**4\. Add Comments**

```c
// Calculate compound interest
float principal = 1000.0;  // Initial amount
float rate = 0.05;         // 5% annual interest rate
int years = 10;            // Investment period

float amount = principal * pow(1 + rate, years);
```

**5\. Use Proper Indentation**

```c
if (condition) {
    if (another_condition) {
        // Nested code is properly indented
        printf("Both conditions are true\n");
    }
    printf("First condition is true\n");
}
```

### **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

**1\. Forgetting Semicolons**

```c
// Wrong
int x = 5
printf("Hello\n")

// Correct
int x = 5;
printf("Hello\n");
```

**2\. Using = Instead of == for Comparison**

```c
// Wrong - this assigns 5 to x and always evaluates to true
if (x = 5) {
    printf("This will always execute\n");
}

// Correct - this compares x to 5
if (x == 5) {
    printf("This executes only if x equals 5\n");
}
```

**3\. Array Index Out of Bounds**

```c
int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

// Wrong - accessing index 5 in an array of size 5
printf("%d\n", arr[5]);  // Undefined behavior

// Correct - valid indices are 0 to 4
printf("%d\n", arr[4]);  // Prints the last element
```

**4\. Not Handling Division by Zero**

```c
// Wrong - could cause runtime error
int result = 10 / 0;

// Correct - check before dividing
int divisor = 0;
if (divisor != 0) {
    int result = 10 / divisor;
} else {
    printf("Cannot divide by zero!\n");
}
```

**5\. Infinite Loops**

```c
// Wrong - infinite loop
int i = 0;
while (i < 10) {
    printf("%d\n", i);
    // Forgot to increment i!
}

// Correct - increment the counter
int i = 0;
while (i < 10) {
    printf("%d\n", i);
    i++;  // Don't forget this!
}
```

## **Practical Exercises**

Now let's put everything together with some hands-on exercises. Try to solve these on your own before looking at the solutions!

### **Exercise 1: Number Guessing Game**

Create a program that generates a random number between 1 and 100, and lets the user guess it:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>

int main() {
    int secret_number, guess, attempts = 0;

    // Seed the random number generator
    srand(time(NULL));
    secret_number = rand() % 100 + 1;  // Random number 1-100

    printf("=== Number Guessing Game ===\n");
    printf("I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\n");
    printf("Can you guess it?\n\n");

    do {
        printf("Enter your guess: ");
        scanf("%d", &guess);
        attempts++;

        if (guess < secret_number) {
            printf("Too low! Try a higher number.\n");
        } else if (guess > secret_number) {
            printf("Too high! Try a lower number.\n");
        } else {
            printf("🎉 Congratulations! You guessed it!\n");
            printf("The number was %d.\n", secret_number);
            printf("It took you %d attempts.\n", attempts);

            // Give feedback on performance
            if (attempts <= 3) {
                printf("Excellent! You're a guessing master!\n");
            } else if (attempts <= 7) {
                printf("Good job! Nice guessing skills!\n");
            } else {
                printf("Not bad! Keep practicing!\n");
            }
        }

        printf("\n");
    } while (guess != secret_number);

    return 0;
}
```

### **Exercise 2: Grade Calculator**

Create a program that calculates a student's final grade based on multiple assignments:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define MAX_ASSIGNMENTS 10

// Function prototypes
float calculate_average(float grades[], int count);
char get_letter_grade(float average);
void display_grade_info(float average, char letter);

int main() {
    float grades[MAX_ASSIGNMENTS];
    int assignment_count = 0;
    float input;

    printf("=== Grade Calculator ===\n");
    printf("Enter assignment grades (0-100). Enter -1 to finish.\n\n");

    // Collect grades
    while (assignment_count < MAX_ASSIGNMENTS) {
        printf("Assignment %d grade: ", assignment_count + 1);
        scanf("%f", &input);

        if (input == -1) {
            break;  // User finished entering grades
        }

        if (input < 0 || input > 100) {
            printf("Please enter a grade between 0 and 100.\n");
            continue;
        }

        grades[assignment_count] = input;
        assignment_count++;
    }

    if (assignment_count == 0) {
        printf("No grades entered. Exiting.\n");
        return 0;
    }

    // Calculate and display results
    float average = calculate_average(grades, assignment_count);
    char letter_grade = get_letter_grade(average);

    printf("\n=== Grade Report ===\n");
    printf("Number of assignments: %d\n", assignment_count);

    printf("Individual grades: ");
    for (int i = 0; i < assignment_count; i++) {
        printf("%.1f ", grades[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");

    display_grade_info(average, letter_grade);

    return 0;
}

float calculate_average(float grades[], int count) {
    float sum = 0.0;
    for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
        sum += grades[i];
    }
    return sum / count;
}

char get_letter_grade(float average) {
    if (average >= 90) return 'A';
    else if (average >= 80) return 'B';
    else if (average >= 70) return 'C';
    else if (average >= 60) return 'D';
    else return 'F';
}

void display_grade_info(float average, char letter) {
    printf("\nFinal Average: %.2f%%\n", average);
    printf("Letter Grade: %c\n", letter);

    // Additional feedback
    switch (letter) {
        case 'A':
            printf("Outstanding work! Keep it up! \n");
            break;
        case 'B':
            printf("Good job! You're doing well! \n");
            break;
        case 'C':
            printf("Satisfactory work. There's room for improvement. \n");
            break;
        case 'D':
            printf("Below average. Consider getting extra help. \n");
            break;
        case 'F':
            printf("Needs significant improvement. Don't give up! \n");
            break;
    }
}
```

### **Exercise 3: Simple Banking System**
